## 📌 Project Overview

This project establishes a virtual cybersecurity and penetration-testing lab using VirtualBox and Kali Linux. The lab provides a safe, controlled environment for practicing security testing — including reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation — without risking real-world systems.

The setup uses a private NAT network, allowing future expansion with additional target machines for authorized testing.
---


## 🎯 Objectives

Install and configure VirtualBox

Import Kali Linux as a VM

Create a private NAT Network

Configure Kali Linux network connectivity

Assign a static IP address to the VM

Verify connectivity and DNS resolution

Take a clean baseline snapshot

Document the entire process

Prepare the lab for future cybersecurity projects
---

## 🛡️ Purpose of the Lab

This lab is designed for learning and ethical security testing. It supports:

Network reconnaissance

Port scanning

Vulnerability assessment

Packet analysis

Web security testing

Exploitation practice

Experimentation with security tools
⚠️ Note: Use this lab only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
---

## 🏗️ Lab Architecture
The NAT network allows attacker and target VMs to communicate internally while maintaining outbound internet access. More machines can be added later for advanced exercises.

Additional target machines can be added to the same virtual network in future projects.

## ⚙️ Lab Configuration

| 🧩 Component       | ⚙️ Configuration   |
| ------------------ | ------------------  |
| 🖥️ Host OS         | Windows 10 1       |
| 🧠 Host RAM        | 32 GB               |
| ⚡ Processor       | Intel Core i7      |
| 🧰 Hypervisor      | VirtualBox 7.2  |

# 🪜 Lab Setup Procedure

##Step 1: 
Install 7-Zip – Extract Kali VM package (.7z).

##Step 2: 
Install VirtualBox – Set up the hypervisor.

##Step 3: Create NAT Network – Configure 10.0.0.0/24 with DHCP enabled.

---

Configuration:
Network Name: NatNetwork
IPv4 Prefix:  10.0.0.0/24
DHCP:         Enabled
IPv6:         Disabled

![](2-screenshot-network-settings-1.png)

A **NAT Network** was selected because multiple virtual machines connected to the same NAT Network can communicate with one another while also having outbound network connectivity.

This will allow future attacker and target VMs to communicate within the lab.


---

## Step 5: Configure Network – Assign static IP (10.0.0.2), gateway (10.0.0.1), DNS (8.8.8.8).

##Step 6: Create Snapshot – Save baseline state (“Clean Kali - Network Setup”).

## Step 4. Import Kali Linux

The Kali Linux virtual machine was downloaded from the official Kali Linux website and imported into VirtualBox.

The VM network adapter was configured as follows:

```text
Adapter 1
Attached to: NAT Network
Network:     NatNetwork
Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop
```

The VM was allocated:

```text
RAM: 2048 MB
```
![](3-screenshot-kali-linux.png)
A shared folder was also configured for transferring required files between the host operating system and the Kali VM.



---

## Step 5. Configure the Kali Linux Network

The Kali Linux network configuration was checked and configured with a consistent IPv4 address.

Example configuration:

```text
IP Address: 10.0.0.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 10.0.0.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8
```

A consistent IP address makes it easier to document the lab and reference the Kali machine in future exercises.

---

## Step 6. Create a Clean VM Snapshot

After completing the initial configuration, a VirtualBox snapshot was created.

Example snapshot name:

```text
Clean Kali - Network Setup
```

The snapshot represents the clean baseline of the laboratory.

If a future exercise changes or damages the VM configuration, the machine can be restored to this baseline.

🐞 Challenges & Fixes

Network was not listed among the tools section in the Virtual Box file menu.
This was resolved to uninstalling and reinstalling the Virtual Box

# 💡 Key Learnings

Through this project, I learned how to create and configure a virtual environment for cybersecurity practice.

The most important concepts I learned include:

### 1. NAT vs NAT Network

A standard NAT configuration and a NAT Network serve different purposes.

A NAT Network allows multiple VMs connected to the same virtual network to communicate with one another while providing network address translation for external connectivity.

This makes it useful for building a multi-machine cybersecurity laboratory.

### 2. Virtual Machine Networking

I learned how VirtualBox virtual network adapters connect virtual machines to different types of networks and how network configuration affects communication between machines.

### 3. Static IP Configuration

I learned how to configure and verify IPv4 addressing, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS settings in Kali Linux.

### 4. VM Snapshots

I learned that a clean snapshot should be created **before performing risky or experimental activities**.

This provides a known-good recovery point for future cybersecurity exercises.

### 5. Documentation

I learned that documenting commands, configuration, screenshots, problems, and solutions is an important part of a professional cybersecurity project.
